# things to note
This was a very frustrating assignment. Purely because I spent most of the time trying to find out why fs.open() didnt open a file and what module to save stuff as a pdf with. Please for the love of god just tell us what modules to use next time. The difficulty that feels rewarding and make me want to try harder is when something is complex and I manage to figure out how to do it. The added difficulty from needing to find the right modules was tiresome and frustrating. The worst part is when that moment came along where everything did come togather, it was sour. I was glad it was over, not happy I had conquered an obstacle.
