# 09-profile-generator
A node based program that will generate a pdf of a github profile. It contains things like the location, the link to the github account, and a link to their blog. A picture of their avatar is also present.

# THIS ONLY WORKS FOR WINDOWS. IF YOU WANT THIS TO WORK ON macOS YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE openFile FUNCTION IN index.js. ON MAC THE APP THAT GETS USED TO OPEN THIS NEEDS TO BE google chrome NOT chrome. LINUX WOULD BE google-chrome

# things to note
This was a very frustrating assignment. Purely because I spent most of the time trying to find out why fs.open() didnt open a file and what module to save stuff as a pdf with. Please for the love of god just tell us what modules to use next time. The difficulty that feels rewarding and make me want to try harder is when something is complex and I manage to figure out how to do it. The added difficulty from needing to find the right modules was tiresome and frustrating. The worst part is when that moment came along where everything did come togather, it was sour. I was glad it was over, not happy I had conquered an obstacle.
